  Now, HEYY!!! Im Dey, and this is a YouTube MP3 Converter, that with just a link u can download your musics and audios that u want to hear, its so bad when u want to download a funny audio and the sites that convert it have virus and stuffs like that so here are the program that does it, its a open code, so you can edit it and see if have virus or something for your
  safety.

   To use it like i said before you need install that package called **ffmpeg**, you can access the link and just download it. So after the install here is the important thing **you need add the path of the package at your "environment variable"**, i will show u how to do that.

   I recommend too that you put the Main file of this Youtube MP3 Converter in some folder, because the program will create a folder called sounds to store up the sounds that you gonna download.

# How to put the ffpmeg at your enviroment variable

  First of all, i hightly recommend that u create a folder that u gonna store up your future packages if you dont have it yet, you can create it in everywhere that you want, so after that u did it lets start.

  Inside the ffpmeg folder have a folder called bin, copy this folder path like this:

  There are the ffmpeg and the ffprobe that is used to convert to MP3.

#

  After it go to the **Enviroment variable**

  Press the WIN button and search for **System**

  In **System** search for **Advanced configs**

  In **Advanced configs** you gonna find the **Enviroment variable**

  if you have some difficult to find it, search it on google

#

  This is the **Enviroment variable**, now you need search for something that is called "Path"
